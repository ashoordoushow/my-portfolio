## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-portfolio.git`  
   `cd my-portfolio`  

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:  
   - Simply double-click on `index.html`, or  
   - Serve it locally using a lightweight web server (e.g., `live-server` or Python's `http.server`):  
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port).  

## Deployment

The website is fully static and can be hosted on any platform supporting HTML files, such as:  
- **GitHub Pages**  
- **Netlify**  
- **Vercel**  

To deploy, upload the entire project folder or the relevant files (`index.html`, `main.css`, images) to your hosting platform.
